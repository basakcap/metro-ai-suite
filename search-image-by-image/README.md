### Important Notice

This reference implementation is designed to facilitate smart cities application development. It is not intended for police, military or similar surveillance uses, use as part of critical infrastructure operations, determining access to education or other significant resource, managing workers or evaluating employment performance.

This reference implementation is intended to allow users to examine and evaluate Search Image by Image application and the associated performance of Intel technology solutions. The accuracy of computer models is a function of the relation between the data used to train them and the data that the models encounter after deployment. This model has been tested using datasets that may not be sufficient for use in production applications. Accordingly, while the model may serve as a strong foundation, Intel recommends and requests that this model be tested against data the model is likely to encounter in specific deployments.

Intel is committed to respecting human rights and avoiding causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights. See Intel’s Global Human Rights Principles. Intel’s products and software are intended only to be used in applications that do not cause or contribute to adverse impacts on human rights.
